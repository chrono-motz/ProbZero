abstract: >-
  ProbZero is an AlphaZero variant that introduces two key modifications:
  (1) a reward-bootstrapped value head where terminal state rewards propagate
  through the search tree to train the value function, enabling all explored
  positions to serve as training data; and (2) a full-tree policy training
  scheme where the policy network learns from WDL (Win/Draw/Loss) probabilities
  over explored children only, weighted by visit counts. Demonstrated on 5×5
  Othello with progressive Elo improvement across training iterations.
